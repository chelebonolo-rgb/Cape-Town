    <p>Cape Town's history is deeply rooted in both colonial and indigenous traditions. The city was a key port for Dutch and British explorers, and its architecture reflects this legacy. Today, it celebrates a mix of cultures, languages, and customs.</p>
    <p>From traditional Xhosa ceremonies to modern art galleries, Cape Town is a cultural mosaic. Festivals, music, and dance are integral to its identity.</p>
    <blockquote>Did you know? Cape Town was the first city outside Europe to get a Nobel Peace Prize laureate's home turned into a museum.</blockquote>
